* Re-architect RemoteImpl into ReadRemote and ReadWriteRemote. This allows us
  to eventually support remotes like HTTP for some commands
* Put each command into a separate binary? This way, users can eventually add
  more commands (like git extensions)
* Command: "external add"
* Command: "push"
* Command: "checkout"
* Better status reporting
* Show volumes that have changed in the runtime from their image
* Eventually write in layer "changesets" that allow to store only small diffs
  corresponding to the exact changed files in a volume
  ...To riff on that, maybe I could even just add a policy that will cache a
  complete volume image in a local checkout, so that the volume doesn't have to
  be completely recreated by applying each of the diffs, every time it's
  deployed. Additionally, maybe this "image" could really be something that's
  mounted, like a loopback device. Maybe I could even add functionality to
  checkout a volume image set to a series of LVM partitions, or something cool
  like that
* Perhaps integrate with Flocker?
* Develop a Docker storage driver
